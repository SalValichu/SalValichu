## In Development

Here's what I'm currently focused on:

*   **Valkura:** A personal hub to connect all my work. Acts as a central database and launcher for everything I’ve created — public, private, or unreleased. Includes one-click installs, project metadata, and integration with my personal systems. It’s the foundation of my brand and development identity.
*   **ClassBand:** A wearable (watch/necklace) that syncs with school timetables. Vibrates before class changes, shows your schedule, integrates with maps for navigation, and may scrape data from systems like Compass. (Early concept, hardware and software)
*   **SCH:** A school-centered productivity app. Provides fast access to class schedules, bells, announcements, and local resources in one dashboard. (Being rebuilt)
*   **CRWN:** A lightweight command-line interface for running scripts, managing utilities, and editing files through its built-in text editor.
*   **(Untitled):** A customizable portfolio and business card site builder for creative developers and freelancers.

> *Past Projects:*

*   **PotShard:** Story-driven game inspired by *Rain World* and *Silksong*. (Development ended)
*   **Croaks:** Collection-based game about catching and evolving frogs. (On heavy pause)
*   **MacOS Keyboard Visualiser 1.0.1:** Refining visuals, adding multi-key support, Improved Editor, Fixing and QOL, etc.
*   **MacOS Roblox Custom Skies 1.0.1 Hotfix:** fixes in progress. *These are due to the roblox updates.*
